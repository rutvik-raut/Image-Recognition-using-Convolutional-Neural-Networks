# Image-Recognition-using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks

Used the CIFAR-10 dataset for recognition of images.
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class.

The agenda of the project was to get introduced to Image Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks and get hands-on with TensorFlow. Also, the ultimate aim was to fine-tune the different parameters of the model to achieve maximum accuracy.
